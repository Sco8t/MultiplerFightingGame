# Multiplayer Fighting Game

This is a simple multiplayer fighting game built with Node.js, Express, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows two players to attack and heal each other until one player's health reaches zero. The game includes sound effects for attacks and healing actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sco8t/MultiplerFightingGame.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd FightingGameNode
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

1. Start the server using `nodemon`:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Game Controls

- **Player 1:**
  - Attack: Press `Q`
  - Heal: Press `A`
- **Player 2:**
  - Attack: Press `P`
  - Heal: Press `L`

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in `public/script.js`. Here’s a brief overview:

- **Player Class**: Represents a player with properties like `name`, `health`, and `attackDmg`. It includes methods such as `strike` (for attacking) and `heal`.
- **Game Class**: Manages the game state and updates it based on player actions. The `updateGame` function checks if either player's health is zero and updates the game state.
- **Event Listeners**: Listens for keyboard inputs to trigger player actions (attack and heal).
- **Simulation**: The `play` function simulates random actions (attacks and heals) between players until one player’s health reaches zero.

### Example Game Logic (Excerpt from `script.js`):

```javascript
class Player {
  constructor(name, health, attackDmg) {
    this.name = name;
    this.health = health;
    this.attackDmg = attackDmg;
  }

strike (player, enemy, attackDmg) {

    attackDmg = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    enemy.health -= attackDmg;
    updateGame(p1, p2, gameState);
    return `${player.name} attacks ${enemy.name} for ${attackDmg} Damage`;
  }

  heal (player) {

    let healVal = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
    player.health += healVal;
    updateGame(p1, p2, gameState);
    return `${player.name} heals for ${healVal}`;

  }
}

class Game {
  updateGame(p1, p2, gameState) {
    // Logic to update game state
  }

  play(p1, p2) {
    while (!(p1.health <= 0 || p2.health <= 0)) {
      const actions = [
        p1.strike(p1, p2, p1.attackDmg),
        p2.strike(p2, p1, p2.attackDmg),
        p1.heal(p1),
        p2.heal(p2)
      ];
      const randomAction = Math.floor(Math.random() * actions.length);
      actions[randomAction];
    }
  }
}
```
